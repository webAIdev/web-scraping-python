# Nimble API Web Scraping Experiments

Welcome to the official repository for code experiments from Nimble's web scraping blog series. This repository is a collection of unique experiments and code snippets that we've discussed in our various articles on web scraping techniques using Nimble API.

## Overview

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific article in our blog series. Inside each folder, you'll find the complete code used in the experiments, along with detailed comments explaining each step of the process. Our goal is to provide a practical, hands-on resource for learning and experimenting with web scraping techniques.

## How to Navigate

1. **Experiments by Article**: Navigate to the sub-folder named after the blog article you're interested in. Each folder contains all the relevant code and resources used in that particular experiment.
